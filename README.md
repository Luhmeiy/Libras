## üìë About

The idea to develop this project initially occurred to me during the Maratona JS Expert 7.0, which was hosted by [Erick Wendel](https://www.youtube.com/@ErickWendelTraining). As I participated in the event and absorbed new knowledge and insights, I began to envision a project that could make a positive impact on people's lives.

As the event came to an end, I jumped right into the project, eager to turn my vision into a reality. My goal was to create a platform that would make learning Brazilian Sign Language more fun and accessible for everyone, regardless of their level of knowledge or experience.

It was a little bit hard sometimes, given the fact that I was still a beginner in TensorFlow and MediaPipe, but the project turned out great.

## üõ†Ô∏è Functionalities

-   Convert Brazilian Sign Language to letters, numbers and expressions.
-   Test your knowledge of Brazilian Sign Language.

## üìö What I Learned

Developing this project was a wild adventure that taught me a lot about the capabilities of technology nowadays. Every bit of information that I discovered during my research just made my eyes glow more. I was eager to improve my knowledge and push these techs to their limits.

But I didn't want to bite more than I could chew, so I started slow, trying to first get the initial knowledge rock solid in my brain. I focused on learning the fundamentals of TensorFlow and MediaPipe, as well as how to work with FingerPose.

Overall, this project taught me a lot about the power of technology and how it can be used to create a more interesting environment for learning. I learned how to use cutting-edge technologies to bring my vision to life, and I gained a deep appreciation for the impact that technology can have on people's lives.
